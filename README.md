R wraper for [Bayesian Mutation Landscape (BML)](http://bml.molgen.mpg.de), a probabilistic approach for reconstructing ancestral 
genotypes from tumor samples for   much larger sets of genes than previously feasible. 
  
The package contains the datasets used within the analysis of the [paper](doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btu319).
